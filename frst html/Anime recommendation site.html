        <h2 class="hcolor">5 Best Dark Fantasy Anime Series To Watch <br>
        </h2>
        <h2><img src="https://www.ualberta.ca/youalberta/media-library/2021/jjk-gif1.gif" alt="fate"></h2>
        <p>Fantasy anime is one of the most popular genres in the medium – but just as there are shows about wonderful worlds full of magic and beauty, as there are shows that explore a darker side of fantasy.

            The dark fantasy genre shines a light on human nature by reminding us the world would be no less cruel were magic real – in fact, it may well make things worse.
            
            If you’re looking for a show with complex characters, absorbing worlds, and storylines where morality and the human condition take center stage – these dark fantasy anime recommendations are a great place to start.</p>

                <p><span id="fate">FATE/ZERO</span>. is set ten years before the events of Fate/stay night, and tells the story of the Fourth Holy Grail War, a secret magical tournament held in Fuyuki City, Japan, where seven mages known as Masters summon Servants, reincarnations of legendary souls and heroes from all across time, where they fight in a deadly battle royale where the winner obtains the Holy Grail, a legendary magical chalice capable of granting wishes. The main protagonist, Kiritsugu Emiya, the foster father of Fate/stay night's protagonist, Shirou Emiya, is known as a ruthless assassin who joins the tournament on behalf of his wife's family, the Einzberns.</p>

                <p><span class="GS">GOBLIN SLAYER</span>. In a world of fantasy, adventurers come from far and wide to join the Guild. They complete contracts to earn gold and glory. An inexperienced priestess joins her first adventuring party, but comes into danger after her first contract involving goblins goes wrong. As the rest of her party is either wiped out or taken out of commission, she is saved by a man known as Goblin Slayer, an adventurer whose only purpose is the eradication of goblins with extreme prejudice.</p>
                <h3 style="color: red;"><a href="https://ww3.gogoanime2.org/anime/made-in-abyss"> 3. MADE IN ABYSS</a></h3>
                <h3><img src="https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/68/65/6B7qIP.jpg" alt=""></h3>
                <p><span class="MIA">MADE IN ABYSS</span>. An orphaned girl named Riko lives in the Belchero Orphanage in the town of Orth. The town surrounds a strange, giant hole descending deep into the earth, which is known as the Abyss. The Abyss harbors artifacts and remnants of civilizations long gone, and is, therefore, a popular hunting spot for so-called Cave Raiders, who undertake arduous and dangerous descents into the mist-filled pit to recover whatever relics they can find. Returning from the Abyss can be dangerous as "the Curse of the Abyss," a mysterious and potentially fatal malady, manifests upon ascension. The deeper one goes, the more acute the effects of the curse; few who have descended into the lower regions have returned to tell of their experiences. Some legendary Cave Raiders earn the title of White Whistles, one of them being Riko's mother, Lyza, who is presumed dead after taking a "last descent" into the Abyss.

                  Riko's longing in life is to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a White Whistle. One day, she discovers a half-human/half-robot boy in the first layer of the Abyss and names him Reg (after a dog that Riko owned). Riko and her friends sneak Reg into Belchero and quickly welcome him into their close-knit group. Sometime later, a number of findings are made from the depths of the Abyss, including Lyza’s White Whistle and pages of discoveries and observations she had made, as well as a message presumably for Riko, stating she is waiting at the bottom of the Abyss. Riko, determined to find her mother, bids farewell to her friends and secretly departs into the Abyss with Reg as her companion.</p>

                <p><span class="AOT">ATTACK ON TITAN</span>. The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher-like weapons called Thunder Spears are also developed.</p>

                <p><span class="Guts">BERSERK.</span>.
                  Bersek is considered to be one of the best manga series out there, but there are a select few titles that blow it out of the water. Berserk is one of the best seinen manga out there. The story has been around in one form or another since 1989, and it's definitely beloved. the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Guts is a lone warrior who was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by his abusive adoptive father Gambino. It came to a head when Guts was forced to kill a drunk Gambino in self-defense, fleeing his mercenary group and becomes a wandering sellsword. His fearsome reputation catches the attention of Griffith, the charismatic leader of a mercenary group known as the Band of the Hawk. Griffith forces Guts to join the group after defeating him in battle, with Guts becoming his best fighter and main confidante. The Band is hired by the kingdom of Midland to help in its century-long war against the Chuder Empire. Guts learns of Griffith's desire to rule a kingdom of his own and his mysterious pendant known as a Behelit. The Behelit is instrumental when they are spared by Nosferatu Zodd, a monstrous immortal who leaves Guts with a cryptic warning of a painful demise for being Griffith's friend. As Griffith mingles with Midland nobility while acquainting himself with the king's daughter Charlotte, Guts begins developing feelings for his fellow commander Casca, the Hawks' only female member. But upon overhearing Griffith confessing to Charlotte that he only considers someone with their own dream as a friend, Guts decides to leave the group once Midland has won its war so he find his own dream. But Gut’s decision inadvertently causes Griffith to fall into a emotional spiral that culminates in being arrested for seducing Charlotte in a moment of weakness, losing his Behelit while subjected to endless torture with Hawks being declared criminals by the Midland army. Guts, having spent a year training to become a better swordsman, is warned by a mysterious being known as the "Skull Knight" that his actions have instigated an "Eclipse". Learning of the Hawks' predicament, Guts rejoins them to rescue Griffith, while also consummating his feelings for Casca.</p>
